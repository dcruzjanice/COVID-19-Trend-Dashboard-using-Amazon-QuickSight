# COVID-19 Trend Dashboard using Amazon QuickSight

## Overview

This project is a COVID-19 Trend Dashboard built with AWS QuickSight, providing users with a comprehensive view of key pandemic metrics. The dashboard includes features to track new cases, new deaths, and vaccination trends at both the continent and country levels. Users can filter data based on date and continent, enabling them to focus on specific time periods and geographic regions of interest.

## Features

1. **Global and Regional Trends**: Explore and visualize COVID-19 trends on a global scale or drill down to specific continents and countries.

2. **Map Display**: View an interactive map representation of the data, making it easy to identify hotspots and trends across different regions.

3. **Date Filtering**: Analyze pandemic data over custom date ranges, allowing users to observe changes and patterns over time.

4. **Continent Filtering**: Focus on specific continents to gain insights into regional variations in COVID-19 metrics.

5. **Vaccination Trends**: The second sheet of the dashboard provides insights into vaccination trends, including the percentage of people fully vaccinated compared to the total population.
